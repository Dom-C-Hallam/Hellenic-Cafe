                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <img src="images/our_story.jpg" alt="A baker kneading dough.">
                    <p>We are a family owned business that started in Parga on the Ionian coast, from Yiayia's kitchen we've become a full 
                       time bakery. 
                       Our family has served the community for generations, with the original recipes never changing. We serve a variety of food, 
                       from sweets and savouries to ice cold frappes. 
                       We take the time to make everything in house and using only the freshest, natural ingredients. 
                       We welcome you to sit, chat and enjoy our traditional bakery. From our home to yours. 
                </p>

                <h2>Sustainability</h2>
                    <img src="images/sustainability.jpg" alt="A bakering flouring dough.">
                    <p>We only use the freshest ingredients and we look to make sure every last bit is gone. We work with local charities to 
                      donate food that would otherwise go to waste. We use traditional methods to cook and bake most of our products, we use 
                      sustainably sourced wood and charcoal.  For every tree we believe gets used we plant two more and work with locals to 
                      protect the surrounding environment.</p>

                    <img src="images/local_produce.jpg" alt="A baker, oven and freshly baked bread.">
                    <p>All of our produce can be traced back to within a few miles of the bakery, working with local farmers to keep the 
                       local economy thriving. We only use what is in season. Our menu will change throughout the year to ensure nothing goes 
                       to waste and you only get the best tasting produce for the best value.</p>
