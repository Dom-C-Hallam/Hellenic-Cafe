PROJECT 2: HELLENIC-CAFE.
=========================
ABOUT:
------
This is my second project where the aim is to build an interactive website for a local cafe..

The project will consist of the following pages:
* Home Page: This will introduce the website and it will be set as the first page the user see's so it will need to grab the users attention and set the tone for the rest of the site.
* About Page: This page will include information about the business, how it was started, its ethos and a little bit about what the cafe sells.
* Category Page: This will be the main page showing the different categories of food and drinks sold at the cafe.
* Products Page: These pages will include more detail about individual products after they have been specifically selected, they will contain images, prices and more detailed descriptions.

Features:
---------
The site will consist of different pages that will all center around a Greek theme due to the nature of the Cafe. There will be a modern twist on an 'Ancient Greek' theme with the main aspects of each page having subtle features to draw the customers attention to the product. I intend on adding a "basket function" where the user can select multiple items, add them to a basket where a number will be shown to help the user keep track of how many items they have. On each product the user will be able to increase the number of any particular item they wish to add to the basket by either directly inputting the number, or using a "+" or "-" button.
