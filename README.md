PROJECT 2: HELLENIC-CAFE.
=========================
ABOUT:
------
This is my second project where the aim is to build an interactive website for a local cafe..

The project will consist of the following pages:
* Home Page: This will introduce the website and it is  the first page the user see's and it sets the theme for the rest of the site.
* About Page: This page includes information about the business, how it was started, its ethos and a little bit about what the cafe sells.
* Menu: This page shows all the products available for the customers to select.
* Contact: On this page you will find a standard contact form.
* Cart: When you select items on the menu page, they will appear in the cart page. The user will be able to remove selected items individually or entirely using the relevant buttons.

Features:
---------
The site will consist of different pages that will all center around a Greek theme due to the nature of the Cafe. There will be a modern twist on an 'Ancient Greek' theme with the main aspects of each page having subtle features to draw the customers attention to the product. 

Technologies:
-------------
This project has been created using the following languages:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

How To Use:
-----------

+ Home page:

When you arrive on the page you will first see the home page. There is a small bit of text at the bottom of the page greeting customers to the site. At the top of all the pages you will find the navigation bar. This will help customers move from one page to the next, all the links work correctly. No matter which page you are on, if there are items in the cart, the number will be shown next to it.

+ About:

This page breifly describes the business to the customer. The layout of this page will vary depending on the type of device you use.

+ Menu:

This page shows all the available items in the store. The user can scroll up and down and select which item they want to add to their cart by clicking the "Add to cart" text. A message will appear letting the user know they have added an item to their cart.

+ Contact:

This is a basic contact form, it will allow the user to enter their details and a small message to the business. The name and email fields have validation within the HTML so users must enter their name, and a valid email address.

+ Cart:

This page will be empty unless the user has added items to the cart from the menu page. The user can either delete specific items from the cart using the button next to it. Or clear the cart entirely.

+ Responsive site:

I used media queries to ensure the site would change to fit several different devices, I looked at the different break points and made sure the site rearranged itself according to the screen size. I wanted to make sure the site was arranged in a way that would suit whichever way the user was scrolling, mouse/finger etc.

This is an example of one of the media queries. I made sure that the relevant media queries were under specific titles and tried to keep all the relevant bits of code together.

SOURCES:

+ Shopping cart feature:

I used several different links to understand how to build a basic cart feature.

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp - Arrays.

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp - Array methods.

https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp - onClick events.

https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_json_parse.asp - JavaScript Parse.

https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp - Local storage.

+ Submission form:

To assist me with creating a submission form I looked at W3 school and changed it to suit my site.

+ Media Queries:

To try and improve my media query application for this project, I watched the following guide to help me better understand how they work.

HTML TESTING:
--------

I ran each page through the W3 validator and addressed the following issues.

HTML LANG.
META CHAR.

I researched the latest "lang" attribute and changed it to "en-gb" and removed the "/" from the META CHAR. This was consistent across all pages.

+ Home:

Testing the home page I found that there was a floating </div> tag, this was removed.

There were no other errors on the home page once this had been addressed.
