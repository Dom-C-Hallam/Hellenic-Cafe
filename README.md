PROJECT 2: HELLENIC-CAFE.
=========================
ABOUT:
------
This is my second project where the aim is to build an interactive website for a local cafe..

The project will consist of the following pages:
* Home Page: This will introduce the website and it will be set as the first page the user see's so it will need to grab the users attention and set the tone for the rest of the site.
* About Page: This page will include information about the business, how it was started, its ethos and a little bit about what the cafe sells.
* Menu: This page shows all the products available for the customers to select.
* Contact: On this page you will find a standard contact form.
* Cart: When you select items on the menu page, they will appear in the cart page. It shows the different items you selected, how many of each items you have selected and the price. There is also a section that shows you the total price. It also features a "clear cart" button that allows you to empty the basket. The cart items are stored using local storage.

Features:
---------
The site will consist of different pages that will all center around a Greek theme due to the nature of the Cafe. There will be a modern twist on an 'Ancient Greek' theme with the main aspects of each page having subtle features to draw the customers attention to the product. I intend on adding a "basket function" where the user can select multiple items, add them to a basket where a number will be shown to help the user keep track of how many items they have.

Technologies:
-------------
This project has been created using the following languages:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

How To Use:
-----------

+ Home page:

When you arrive on the page you will first see the home page. There is a small bit of text at the bottom of the page greeting customers to the site. At the top of all the pages you will find the navigation bar. This will help customers move from one page to the next, all the links work correctly. No matter which page you are on, if there are items in the cart, the number will be shown next to it.

+ About:

This page breifly describes the business to the customer. The layout of this page will vary depending on the type of device you use.

On a laptop the images are shown side by side, on smaller devices the images and words are shown vertically and in order. This was to try and assist with the readability of the text, ensuring that everything was an appropriate size for the user.
